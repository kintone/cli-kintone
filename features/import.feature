Feature: cli-kintone import command

  Scenario: CliKintoneTest-23 Should import the records with API Token successfully
    Given The app "app_for_import" has no records
    And The csv file "CliKintoneTest-23.csv" with content as below:
      | Text   | Number |
      | Alice  | 10     |
      | Bob    | 20     |
      | Jenny  | 30     |
    And Load app ID of app "app_for_import" as env var: "APP_ID"
    And Load app token of app "app_for_import" with permission "add" as env var: "API_TOKEN"
    When I run the command with args "record import --base-url $$TEST_KINTONE_BASE_URL --app $APP_ID --api-token $API_TOKEN --file-path CliKintoneTest-23.csv"
    Then I should get the exit code is zero
    And The app "app_for_import" should has records as below:
      | Text   | Number |
      | Alice  | 10     |
      | Bob    | 20     |
      | Jenny  | 30     |
