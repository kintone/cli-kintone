We are happy to announce the release of **cli-kintone v1.12.0** ðŸŽ‰

## What's new?

There are two notable updates.

### cli-kintone is available on npmjs.com now!

We started to publish cli-kintone to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) as [`@kintone/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kintone/cli).

Run the `npm install` command to install:

```shell
npm i -g @kintone/cli
```

For more details, see the [Installation](/guide/installation/#from-npmjscom) page.

cli-kintone is mainly used for kintone automations by IT administrators, but also used in plugin/customization development and on CI/CD.

This update is to provide easier installation for developers in a Node.js installed environment.

We defined **Stability Index** to indicate features stability.
