We are happy to announce the release of **cli-kintone v1.12.3** ðŸŽ‰

## What's new?

### New command: plugin commands (Experimental)

We implemented two new commands to operate kintone plugins.

:::warning
These commands are still under development.  
Please see our [Stability Index](/community/stability-index/#experimental) how we update experimental features.
:::

#### cli-kintone plugin info

[`plugin info`](/guide/commands/plugin-info/) is a command to see information of specified plugin.

```shell
cli-kintone plugin info --input ./dist/plugin.zip
# output:
# [2024-12-04T09:14:15.353Z] WARN: [Experimental] This feature is under early development
# id: jimcpjmdikgpjkdkkglpaokoakhmfiee
# name: hello-kintone
# version: 1
# description: hello-kintone
# homepage: (not set)
```

#### cli-kintone plugin pack

[`plugin pack`](/guide/commands/plugin-pack/) is an alternative command to [plugin-packer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kintone/plugin-packer).

```shell
cli-kintone plugin pack --input ./src --output ./dist --private-key ./private.ppk
# output:
# [2024-12-04T09:15:32.481Z] WARN: [Experimental] This feature is under early development
# [2024-12-04T09:15:32.511Z] WARN: Property "homepage_url.en" is missing.
# [2024-12-04T09:15:32.967Z] INFO: The plugin file generated: plugin.zip
```

This command supports [experimental new plugin system](https://kintone.cybozu.co.jp/update/main/2024-12.html#indev).
