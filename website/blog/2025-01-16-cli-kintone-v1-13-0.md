We are happy to announce the release of **cli-kintone v1.13.0** üéâ

## What's new?

### The `--experimental-use-server-side-upsert` option is now available with the record import command (Experimental)

We have implemented the `--experimental-use-server-side-upsert` option, which executes the record import command using [the upsert option of the bulk record update API](https://cybozu.dev/ja/kintone/docs/rest-api/records/update-records/)

Previously, cli-kintone has been running with its own upsert mode, but by using `--experimental-use-server-side-upsert`, there is a possibility that the performance of the record import command will improve.

Specify as follows.

```
$ cli-kintone record import --base-url http://localhost --app xxx \
 --api-token xxx  \
 --file-path import.csv \
 --update-key „É¨„Ç≥„Éº„ÉâÁï™Âè∑ \
 --experimental-use-server-side-upsert
```

We plan to enable this option by default once we have confirmed its stability.

## Miscellaneous

See the [changelog](https://github.com/kintone/cli-kintone/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#1130-2025-01-16) for an exhaustive list of changes.
