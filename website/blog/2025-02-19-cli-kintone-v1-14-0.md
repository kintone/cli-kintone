We are happy to announce the release of **cli-kintone v1.14.0** ðŸŽ‰

## What's new?

### cli-kintone retries download/upload attachment files on 5xx error

File upload/download API requests may occasionally fail for various reasons.
This update helps avoid having to redo the entire process due to these failures.
Now, cli-kintone automatically retries on the following API errors.

- [Download File](https://kintone.dev/en/docs/kintone/rest-api/files/download-file/) (`GET /k/v1/file.json`)
  - 5xx errors
- [Upload File](https://kintone.dev/en/docs/kintone/rest-api/files/upload-file/) (`POST /k/v1/file.json`)
  - 5xx errors

We use [an exponential backoff with jitter](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/) as our retry strategy.

## Miscellaneous

See the [changelog](https://github.com/kintone/cli-kintone/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#1140-2025-02-19) for an exhaustive list of changes.
