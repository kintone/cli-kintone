We are happy to announce the release of **cli-kintone v1.14.2** ðŸŽ‰

ðŸ‘‰ [Download this version here](https://github.com/kintone/cli-kintone/releases/tag/v1.14.2)

## What's new?

### Server-side UPSERT is now the default behavior

In [v1.13.0](./2025-01-16-cli-kintone-v1-13-0.md), we introduced the `--experimental-use-server-side-upsert` option to enable the `upsert` mode of the [Update Records](https://kintone.dev/en/docs/kintone/rest-api/records/update-records/) API.

Starting with this release, server-side UPSERT is now the default behavior.

Depending on the execution conditions, this change may improve import performance and reduce the number of API requests.

The `--experimental-use-server-side-upsert` option is now deprecated.  
Specifying this option in this version will show a warning (not an error), but the option will be removed entirely in a future release.

## Miscellaneous

See the [changelog](https://github.com/kintone/cli-kintone/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#1142-2025-08-06) for an exhaustive list of changes.
