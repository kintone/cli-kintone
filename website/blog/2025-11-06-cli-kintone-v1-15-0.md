### Interface changes (Experimental)

We have made some updates to the `plugin pack` command and introduced a new `plugin keygen` command.

:::warning
These commands are still under development.  
For details on how experimental features evolve, please refer to our [Stability Index](/community/stability-index/#experimental).
:::

#### [`cli-kintone plugin pack`](/guide/commands/plugin-pack/)

This command focuses on packaging plugin source code into a distributable zip file.
Private key generation is now handled by a separate command (`plugin keygen`).

##### ✨ Changes in this version

- Added `plugin keygen` command to generate a private key.
- Made `--input` and `--private-key` options required.
- `--input` option now accepts the file path of a manifest JSON instead of a plugin directory.
- `--output` option now accepts a zip file path instead of a directory.
- Added short-hand aliases:
  - `-i` for `--input`
  - `-o` for `--output`

```shell
cli-kintone plugin pack \
  --input ./manifest.json \
  --private-key ./private.ppk \
  --output ./dist/plugin.zip
# output:
# [2025-11-06T08:52:09.454Z] WARN: [Experimental] This feature is under early development
# [2025-11-06T08:52:09.596Z] INFO: The plugin file generated: /Users/me/dist/plugin.zip
```

#### [`cli-kintone plugin keygen`](/guide/commands/plugin-keygen/)

Generates a private key for plugin packaging.

```shell
cli-kintone plugin keygen --output private.ppk
# output:
# [2025-11-06T08:53:39.194Z] WARN: [Experimental] This feature is under early development
# [2025-11-06T08:53:39.420Z] INFO: New private key generated: /Users/me/private.ppk
```
