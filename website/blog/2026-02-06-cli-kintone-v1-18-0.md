## What's new?

### Official release of plugin and customize commands

We are excited to announce that the **plugin commands** and **customize commands** have graduated from Experimental status and are now officially released.

These commands were introduced as experimental features in previous releases ([v1.15.0](/blog/cli-kintone-v1-15-0/), [v1.16.0](/blog/cli-kintone-v1-16-0/), [v1.17.0](/blog/cli-kintone-v1-17-0/)) and have been stabilized based on user feedback and testing.

#### Plugin commands

The plugin commands provide functionality equivalent to [@kintone/plugin-packer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kintone/plugin-packer) and [@kintone/plugin-uploader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kintone/plugin-uploader).
