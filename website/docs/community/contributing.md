# Contributing

We always welcome your contribution! This document provides how to contribute to cli-kintone.

## Code of Conduct

Before starting contribution, please see [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/kintone/.github/blob/main/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) first.

## Supporting resources

If you have any questions or feedbacks, you can check our [supporting resources](/community).

## Issues

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/kintone/cli-kintone/issues) for bug reports and feature requests.

Before submitting an Issue, please make sure that there is no related Issue already.

When creating an Issue, be sure to fill out the Issue template. Especially, a [minimum reproduction](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) is really important to fix a bug and directly lead to faster triage.

## Pull Requests

If you are going to make a [PR contribution](https://github.com/kintone/cli-kintone/pulls), please make sure that a corresponding Issue exist first.
In addition, we encourage you to make a proposal in the Issue before starting implementation.

## Development

### Setup repository

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) should be configured.

Clone and move into the repository

```shell
git clone git@github.com:kintone/cli-kintone.git
cd cli-kintone
```

Install dependencies

```shell
corepack enable
pnpm install
```

Run build command to check if the repository is ready.

```shell
pnpm build
```

### Build

Currently, we have different build processes for the npm package and executables.

To build both of them, run `build:all` command:

```shell
pnpm build:all
```

#### Build npm package

Run `build` command:

```shell
pnpm build
```

To build in watch mode, run `start` command:

```shell
pnpm start
```

To check behavior, run the entrypoint file directly:

```shell
./cli.js
```

#### Build executables

Run `build:artifacts` command:

```shell
pnpm build:artifacts
```

Executables will be generated in `bin` directory.

```
bin
├── cli-kintone-linux-x64
├── cli-kintone-macos-arm64
└── cli-kintone-win-x64.exe
```

### Testing

We have two kinds of tests, unit tests and E2E tests.
You can view [test reports](https://kintone.github.io/cli-kintone/index.html) generated by [Allure Report](https://allurereport.org/).

#### Unit tests

When you change implementation, corresponding unit tests must be added or updated.

Unit tests are located in the `__tests__` directory next to the test target code.

Please read [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) document to know how to write unit tests.

You can run unit tests using `test` command:

```shell
pnpm test
```

:::note
We also run tests on CI, so local execution is optional.
:::

#### E2E tests

E2E testing is based on practical scenarios. We use [Cucumber](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js).

All of our E2E tests are located in [`features`](https://github.com/kintone/cli-kintone/tree/main/features) directory of repository root.

You can run E2E tests using `test:e2e` command:

```shell
pnpm test:e2e
```

Unfortunately, an actual kintone environment with API access is required to run E2E tests.
Therefore, we recommend to run on CI.

##### Parallel execution

E2E tests are executed in parallel by default to speed up test execution. The default configuration allows up to 10 tests to run concurrently.

In some cases, you may want to run tests sequentially. For example, when multiple tests share the same resource (such as a specific kintone app), they should not run at the same time to avoid conflicts.

To run a specific scenario sequentially, use the `@serial` tag with a resource identifier:

```gherkin
@serial(app_in_space_for_export)
Scenario: App in a space
  Given The app "app_in_space_for_export" has no records
  ...
```

Scenarios with the same `@serial(resource)` tag will not run concurrently with each other. However, they can still run in parallel with scenarios that have different `@serial` tags or no `@serial` tag at all.

**Examples of resource identifiers used in existing E2E tests:**

| Resource Identifier          | Description                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app_for_export`             | General purpose app for testing record export functionality                                                      |
| `app_for_import`             | General purpose app for testing record import functionality                                                      |
| `app_for_export_attachments` | App with attachment fields for testing file download functionality                                               |
| `app_for_export_table`       | App with table fields for testing table data export                                                              |
| `app_in_space_for_export`    | App located in a kintone space for testing space-related features                                                |
| `app_in_guest_space`         | App located in a guest space for testing guest space access                                                      |
| `plugin_<plugin_id>`         | Plugin resource for testing plugin upload/update functionality (e.g., `plugin_chjjmgadianhfiopehkbjlfkfioglafk`) |

Multiple test scenarios that operate on the same resource should use the same `@serial` tag to prevent race conditions during parallel test execution.

For more details about parallel execution in Cucumber, see the [official documentation](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/main/docs/parallel.md).

### Documentation website

The documentation website (this website!) must be updated in the same PR.

Edit files in [`website/docs`](https://github.com/kintone/cli-kintone/tree/main/website/docs) to update documents.

To preview changes on local, run `doc:start` command:

```shell
pnpm doc:start
```

### Internationalization (i18n)

The documentation website supports multiple languages. Currently, we support English (default) and Japanese.

#### Translation workflow

1. **Update English documentation** - Always update English docs first in `website/docs/`
2. **Translate to Japanese** - Add translations in `website/i18n/ja/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/`
3. **Update translation progress** - Run the command to update the translation percentage in the language switcher:

```shell
cd website
pnpm update-translation-progress
```

This command will:

- Count English and Japanese documentation files
- Calculate translation percentage
- Update the language switcher label (e.g., "日本語 (28%)")

4. **Preview both languages** - Test your changes in both languages:

```shell
# English version
pnpm doc:start

# Japanese version
pnpm doc:start --locale ja
```

#### File structure

```
website/
├── docs/                      # English documentation (source)
│   ├── guide/
│   ├── reference/
│   └── community/
├── i18n/ja/                   # Japanese translations
│   └── docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/
│       └── current/           # Translated docs
│           ├── guide/
│           ├── reference/
│           └── community/
```

#### Translation guidelines

- **Maintain structure** - Keep the same file structure and frontmatter
- **Use `@site/` for imports** - In translated files, use `@site/` alias for React component imports:
  ```javascript
  import Component from "@site/src/components/Component";
  ```
- **Copy images** - Copy images to the same relative path in the i18n directory
- **Keep `.md` extensions** - Use `.md` extension in internal links (e.g., `[link](./page.md)`)
- **Update regularly** - Run `pnpm update-translation-progress` after adding translations

For more details about Docusaurus i18n, see the [official documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/introduction).

### Linting

Before commit your work, please run `lint` command:

```shell
pnpm lint
```

You can run auto-fix with `fix` command:

```shell
pnpm fix
```

### Stability

We define the [Stability Index](./stability-index.md) to indicate stability of features.

For experimental/deprecated features, please add [admonitions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions) on docs and show warnings on CLI.

#### Admonitions

To add admonitions, use `experimental` or `deprecated` admonition type.

```markdown
:::experimental[Title]

:::
```

:::experimental[Title]

Body

:::

```markdown
:::deprecated[Title]

Body

:::
```

:::deprecated[Title]

Body

:::

#### CLI Warnings

To show warnings on CLI, use helper functions.

```typescript
emitExperimentalWarning("This feature is under early development.");
```

```typescript
emitDeprecationWarning(
  "This feature has been deprecated.\nUse new option instead.",
);
```
