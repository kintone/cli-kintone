# record delete

The `delete` command allows you to delete records of a specified Kintone app.

**Notice**

- This command only supports API token authentication.
- This action cannot be rolled back.

## Example

```shell
cli-kintone record delete \
  --base-url https://${yourDomain} \
  --api-token ${apiToken} \
  --app ${kintoneAppId} \
  --file-path ${filepath}
```

You can bypass the confirmation step by using the options `--yes` or `-y`.

## Options

## Delete all records

All records of the target app will be deleted if the option `--file-path` is not specified.

## Delete specific records

Specific records can be deleted by specifying the option `--file-path`.

The value of the `--file-path` must be the path to the CSV file and should meet the following requirements:

- The file extension should be ".csv".
- The header row of the CSV file must be the record number field code defined in the target app.
- If using the app code in the record number:
  - Every row should contain the same app code (not mixed).
  - The app code is equal to the target app's one.
