## Path naming

```
<attachment-dir>/<field code>-<record id>/<filename>
```

The attachment field on a table

```
<attachment-dir>/<the field code>-<record id>-<the index of the row on the table>/<filename>
```

The flow of the conversion process for file names

1. Replace prohibited characters (Windows only)
2. Rename the duplicated file name

## Replace prohibited characters (Windows only)

If running on a Windows environment and the filename contains Windows-prohibited characters, replace them with `_`.

Windows prohibited characters are `< > : " / \ | ? *`.

Example:

```
text<>.txt → text__.txt
```

## Rename the duplicated file name

When the attachment fields has same file names

```
<filename> (<index>).<ext>
```

Example:

```
Portfolio.pdf
Portfolio (1).pdf
Portfolio (2).pdf
Portfolio (3).pdf
```

NOTE: The destination directory will be created automatically if it doesn’t exist.
