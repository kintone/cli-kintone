## How cli-kintone chooses the field to read from the CSV file

When running the import command

- Without the `--fields` option:
  - All fields in the CSV file that exist on the Kintone app will be imported.
- With the `--fields` option:
  - See the [Specify target fields](../target-fields.md) page.

## How cli-kintone treats missing field/empty string in CSV

- If the field is missing on the header of the CSV file => cli-kintone will ignore that field.
- If the field value in the row is an empty string => cli-kintone will add/update that field with an empty string.
